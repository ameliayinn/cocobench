{"task_id": "python/7", "evaluation": "This code defines a class Solution with a method count that takes four parameters: num1, num2, min_sum, and max_sum. It uses a helper function solve that takes a string R as input and uses a recursive function dfs to count the number of strings that satisfy certain conditions. The dfs function uses memoization with the @cache decorator to avoid redundant calculations. The count method then calls the solve function twice, once with num2 and once with num1 decremented by 1, and returns the difference between the two results modulo 10^9 + 7. The code uses the ord function to convert characters to their corresponding ASCII values and subtracts the ASCII value of '0' to get the digit value. The tight parameter in the dfs function is used to check if the current digit is the maximum possible value in the current position. The code also uses the modulo operator to ensure the result is within the range of a 32-bit integer. The example usage shows how to call the count method with specific inputs.", "token_count": 311}
