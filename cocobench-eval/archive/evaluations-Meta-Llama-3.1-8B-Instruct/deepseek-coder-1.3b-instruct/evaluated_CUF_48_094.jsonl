{"task_id": "cpp/1", "evaluation": "In this code, we have a function `compare` that takes two strings as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two strings are equivalent or not. The function uses `std::istringstream` to parse the input strings into lines and then compares each line of the content with the corresponding line of the groundtruth. If any pair of lines is not equal, the function immediately returns `false`. If all pairs of lines are equal, the function returns `true`. In the `main` function, we test the `compare` function with several pairs of input strings to demonstrate its usage. Note that the `compare` function assumes that the input strings are newline-separated and that the groundtruth string has the same number of lines as the content string. If these assumptions are not met, the function may produce incorrect results. The function is designed to be used in a context where the input strings are outputs of code snippets and the comparison is based on the exact content of the strings, including newlines.
