Note that this code assumes that the JSON objects have a key called `mat` with a 2D list value, which is converted to a numpy array for comparison. If the JSON objects have a different structure, the code may need to be modified accordingly.  The code uses the `np.array_equal` function to compare the arrays, which checks for exact equality.
