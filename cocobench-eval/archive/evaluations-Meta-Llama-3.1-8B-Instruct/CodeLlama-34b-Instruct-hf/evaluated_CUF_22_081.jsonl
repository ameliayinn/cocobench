The function first initializes a dictionary `result` with the task ID and an initial evaluation of \"Incorrect\".

If they are equal, it updates the evaluation in the `result` dictionary to \"Correct\". Finally, it returns the `result` dictionary as a JSON string. The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with the provided content and groundtruth arrays.  The output will be the JSON string indicating whether the content matches the groundtruth.  The task ID is \"numpy/25\".  The content and groundtruth arrays are compared using NumPy's array_equal function.  The function returns a JSON string indicating whether the comparison was correct or incorrect.  The JSON string has two fields: task_id and evaluation.  The task_id field contains the task ID \"numpy/25\".  The evaluation field contains either \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\" depending on the comparison result.
