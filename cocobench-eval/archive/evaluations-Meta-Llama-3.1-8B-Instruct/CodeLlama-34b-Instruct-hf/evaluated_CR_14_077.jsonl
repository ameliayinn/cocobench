I'll make sure to update the code to produce the correct output.  I've written the code to handle the case where the 'logical_errors' key is missing from either the content or groundtruth dictionaries, and it returns 'Correct' if they are both missing. If the 'logical_errors' key is present in both dictionaries but has different values, it returns 'Incorrect'.  If the 'logical_errors' key is present in only one of the dictionaries, it returns 'Incorrect'.  Let me know if this is not the expected behavior.  The code also assumes that the 'logical_errors' dictionary in the groundtruth has the same structure as the one in the content. If this is not the case, please let me know and I'll adjust the code accordingly.  The code uses the `json.dumps` function to convert the result dictionary to a JSON string with indentation. You can remove this line if you don't need the JSON output.  Please let me know if this code meets your requirements.
