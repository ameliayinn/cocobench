{"task_id": "python/7", "evaluation": "The code defines a class Solution with a method count that takes four parameters: num1, num2, min_sum, and max_sum. The method uses a recursive approach with memoization to count the number of good numbers that satisfy the conditions. The evaluate function takes a task ID, content, and groundtruth as input, creates an instance of the Solution class, and calls the count method. If the result matches the groundtruth, it returns a JSON object with \"Correct\" as the evaluation; otherwise, it returns \"Incorrect\". The code then tests this function with a sample input.  The output will be a JSON object with the evaluation result.  The provided code does not include any error handling or input validation, so it is assumed that the input will always be valid.  If the input is not valid, the code may not work as expected.  The code uses a recursive approach with memoization to solve the problem, which may not be the most efficient solution for large inputs.  However, for the given constraints, it should work correctly.  The code does not include any explanations or justifications for the solution, as per the problem requirements.
