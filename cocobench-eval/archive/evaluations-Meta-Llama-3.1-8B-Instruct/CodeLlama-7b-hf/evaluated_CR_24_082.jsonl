The `evaluate_code_snippet` function takes the code snippet as input, parses it using `ast.parse`, and then checks for syntax errors by calling `ast.NodeVisitor().visit`. If a syntax error is found, it is added to the `syntax_errors` list. The function then checks for logical errors by iterating over the abstract syntax tree and checking for unreachable code. If unreachable code is found, it is added to the `logical_errors` list. Finally, the function returns the evaluation result as a dictionary. The code snippet is then evaluated using the `evaluate_code_snippet` function, and the evaluation result is determined by checking if the syntax errors match the ground", "token_count": 178}
