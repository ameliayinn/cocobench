{"task_id": "python/11", "evaluation": "The provided Python code defines a function specialPerm that takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer representing the number of special permutations of the input list. The function first initializes an empty dictionary special_nums to store the indices of numbers that divide each number in the input list. It then iterates over the input list, for each pair of numbers, it checks if one number is divisible by the other, and if so, it appends the index of the other number to the list of the current number in the dictionary. The function then defines a recursive function countPerm that takes a mask and a lastDigit as input, and returns the number of special permutations of the input list that satisfy the given mask and lastDigit. The function finally returns the result of countPerm with an initial mask of 0 and a lastDigit of -1, modulo 10^9 + 7.
