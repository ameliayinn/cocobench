Also, this solution does not handle cases where the content and groundtruth are not lists of strings. It simply compares the two lists of strings for equality. If you need to handle other cases, you would need to add additional logic to the solution.  The code provided is a basic example and might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the input data.  It is recommended to add error checking code to handle potential edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with different lengths.
