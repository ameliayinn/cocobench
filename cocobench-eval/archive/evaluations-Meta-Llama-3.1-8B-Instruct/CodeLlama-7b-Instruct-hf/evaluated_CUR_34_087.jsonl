{"task_id": "cpp/0", "evaluation": "This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the longest substring with unique characters. It iterates over the input string, maintaining a set of unique characters within the current window. When a duplicate character is found, it slides the window to the right by removing characters from the left until the duplicate is removed. The maximum length substring with unique characters is tracked and updated accordingly. Finally, it compares the longest substring with unique characters to the groundtruth value and returns the evaluation result.  The solution adheres to the specified format and requirements.  It does not include any additional code or explanations.  It simply provides the code that implements the solution.  The code is written in Python and uses a set to keep track of unique characters within the sliding window.  The solution is concise and efficient, making it suitable for large input strings.  The solution is also well-structured and easy to understand, following standard professional guidelines for code quality.  It includes proper indentation, spacing, and naming conventions, making it easy to read and maintain.  The solution is also well-documented, with clear and concise comments that explain the purpose and behavior of each section of code.  The solution is also efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.  This is because it only needs to iterate over the input string once, using a single pass to find the longest substring with unique characters.  The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the length of the input string, due to the use of a set to keep track of unique characters within the sliding window.  Overall, the solution is a well-crafted, efficient, and effective implementation of the problem.  It adher", "token_count": 246}
