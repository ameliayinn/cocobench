The findall method returns all non-overlapping matches of this pattern in the string as a list of strings, where each string is a tuple of the matched groups. The length of this list is then returned as the count of key changes.  This script does not provide any output for incorrect inputs. If the input string does not contain any key changes, the function will return 0. If the input string is empty, the function will return 0. If the input string contains only one character, the function will return 0.  The script does not handle any exceptions that might occur during execution.  The script uses the re module, which is a built-in Python module for regular expressions. The re.sub function is used to remove non-alphabetic characters from the input string, and the re.findall function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the string.  The script does not provide any explanations or justifications for the result. The result is simply a JSON object with the task ID and the evaluation result.  The script assumes that the input string only contains lowercase and uppercase English letters, as specified in the problem statement. If the input string contains other characters, the script may not work correctly.  The script does not provide any information about the time or space complexity of the solution. The solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, because it uses", "token_count": 456}
