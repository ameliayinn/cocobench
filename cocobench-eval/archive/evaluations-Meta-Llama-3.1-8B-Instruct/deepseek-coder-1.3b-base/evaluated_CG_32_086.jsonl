The method returns the index of the first complete row in mat that contains all elements of arr. The code uses an unordered_map to store the indices of elements in mat, and two vectors to count the number of times each row and column is visited. It iterates over arr, and for each element, it increments the count of the corresponding row and column. If a row or column is fully visited, it returns the current index. If no complete row is found, it returns -1. The code is equivalent to the groundtruth code, but with some minor differences in variable naming and code organization. The evaluation result is \"Correct\" because the code produces the correct output for the given input.  The code is well-structured, readable, and follows good coding practices. The use of an unordered_map and vectors for counting makes the code efficient and scalable.Overall, this code is a good example of a well-written and efficient solution to the problem. It demonstrates good coding practices, such as using meaningful variable names, following a consistent coding style, and using data structures effectively.  The code is also easy to read and understand, making it a good example for others to learn from.
