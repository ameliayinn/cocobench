{"task_id": "python/26", "content": "\n\nA: The first thing to do when figuring out if a piece of code is insecure is to run it through a security checker, such as SANS Buffer Overflow or CheckMark Security Intrusion Detection (CSID), so you can identify areas of concern.  I am not sure why your email password field has \"None\" in it.\nYou can see that in the security checker, you can see the password field with the length \"0\" and the data type being None.  It could be an empty password (the password you have given is the empty string).\nI ran a second security check on this code and found that you can make an actual user input in your code to get the password.  Try this:\ndef SendEmail(to, subject, body, emailPass):\n    smtp_server = 'smtp.example.com'\n    user_name = 'example_user'\n    if emailPass == '':\n        emailPass = input('Please enter your password: ')\n    # Email sending logic\n    return True\n\n\nA: You should never check the password in plaintext. You should use a hash function like a salted hashing algorithm on the password. When you get the password from the user, you must do the same thing.\nYou have a password field which is always equal to None. The way you have that defined has two security implications. First, it makes it difficult to guess the password and second, it makes it difficult for anyone to see what the password actually is. To make the second point even less important, use a strong password. Otherwise, the program will be brute-forcing and possibly getting in.\nIn order to prevent this issue, use a one time key (OTK) in addition to the salt. The OTK gets prepended to the hash, so that both pieces of information are hashed together. This means that a programmer can't look at what the hash value is to see the OTK. If they do, they can't figure out what the password is, and if they do, they have no idea that the program is really looking at a password.\nI recommend using bcrypt. This is probably the best way to do it, but it requires you to write some extra code to hash and salt the password you get from the user. You'll probably want to look at a third party solution for", "groundtruth": {"security_issues": {"lines": ["if emailPass == '':", "def SendEmail(to, subject, body, emailPass):"], "description": "Passing sensitive information like email password as a function argument can lead to accidental exposure."}}}
