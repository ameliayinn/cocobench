If there is a problem in a certain aspect, write the specific problem code snippet into the corresponding area. If there is no problem in a certain aspect, fill in None in this area to indicate that there is no problem.\n{'requirement': 'Check Python code snippets...', 'problem_code': 'def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):\\n    i, j = 0, 0\\n    mergedList = []\\n    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):\\n        if list1[i] < list2[i]:  # Logical error in comparison\\n            mergedList.append(list1[i])\\n            i += 1\\n        else:\\n            mergedList.append(list2[j])\\n            j += 1\\n    mergedList += list1[i:] + list2[j:]  # Could result in duplicates if not careful\\n    return mergedList'}\nPlease review the problematic function in the problem_code part according to the requirement part.\nErrors are classified into performance_issues, security_issues, irregular_naming and logical_errors.
