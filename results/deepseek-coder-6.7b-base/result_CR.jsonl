Pylint is used to check your code to get feedback on its best practices.\nA syntax error, as you have already identified it, is the first kind of error Pylint can raise. To solve it, just change data to (data,). Also change data_items to data_items, etc.\nPerformance and security issues are usually the most complex error that Pylint raises. In order to get a lot of such errors, your program must be performing complex or slow operations in order to raise such issues. Pylint will check for these issues if the user has provided the --performance-suggestions or --enable=all option (see Pylint's documentation for more information).\nI have no idea about how Pylint can tell logical errors from syntax errors. Perhaps you should contact the maintainer of Pylint to request support for this functionality (and/or a way to turn such errors into warnings).\nI strongly recommend you to use a tool like Pycharm or Pydev in order to improve your code.

Instead, you can use a set data structure, which has faster lookup times and supports adding unique elements, to store the unique even numbers.\n\nSecurity issues:\n\nThe getpass module in Python provides a secure way to read a password without displaying it on the console or terminal. It is commonly used for password prompts. You are assigning a password value using this module, which should not be done in a script or program. Instead, you should get the password value securely using a password prompt or a similar mechanism.\n\nSyntax errors:\n\nIn Python, the print function is used to output messages, and in this case, you are calling it with two variables a and b. The syntax is invalid and should be corrected by adding parentheses or concatenating the variables. For example, print(\"a =\", a, \", b =\", b) or print(\"a =\" + a + \", b =\" + b).\n\nLogical errors:\n\nThe if-else statement in the unique_even_numbers function is using an incorrect condition.
