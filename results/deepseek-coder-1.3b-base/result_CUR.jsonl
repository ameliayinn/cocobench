For example MONTH(CURDATE()) is 2 (Feb) instead of 2 (2).  But then the dates are different (Jan) vs. (Feb).\nI've tried a few of these and it seems to work fine:\n# MySQL 8.0\nSELECT employee_id, name, hire_date \nFROM employees \nWHERE MONTH(hire_date) = MONTH(CURDATE());\n\n# MySQL 5.7\nSELECT employee_id, name, hire_date \nFROM employees \nWHERE MONTH(hire_date) = MONTH(CURDATE())-1;\n\n# MySQL 5.7\nSELECT employee_id, name, hire_date \nFROM", "groundtruth": [{"employee_id": 1, "name": "John", "hire_date": "2017-04-15"}, {"employee_id": 2, "name": "Alice", "hire_date": "2019-04-23"}, {"employee_id": 3, "name": "Bob", "hire_date": "2020-02-10"}, {"employee_id": 4, "name": "Charlie", "hire_date": "2021-04-01"}, {"employee_id": 5, "name": "Diana", "hire_date": "2018-07-19"}]}

{"task_id": "sql/12", "content": "\nI have tried solving this using case function, but it is not giving correct answer.\nPlease help me in solving it.\n\nA: I think your problem is that in the case statement, you're only comparing the salary variable with its value, but you can't compare it to commission. For your case, salary is a field in your Sales_staff table.\nYou can create a new query that will show you the data from commission with a query like this:\nSELECT DISTINCT name, \nCASE \n    WHEN commission IS NULL THEN 'C'\n    WHEN salary > 60000 THEN 'B'\n    ELSE 'A'\nEND AS membership\nFROM sales_staff\nWHERE commission IS NOT NULL;\n\nThen, to join that query with the sales_staff table, you need to use an INNER JOIN, and give a specific name to the new query (for example, \"membership_query\")\n", "groundtruth": [{"name": "John Doe", "salary": 55000, "commission": null}, {"name": "Jane Smith", "salary": 75000, "commission": 5000}, {"name": "Alice Johnson", "salary": 61000, "commission": null}, {"name": "Bob Brown", "salary": 45000, "commission": 2000}, {"name": "Charlie Davis", "salary": 60000, "commission": null}]}
