The reason for that is, if we compute the powers for [1, 2] from [1, 3], then the powers for [1, 4] will not be calculated again as the numbers [2, 4] will also be covered by the powers for [1, 2].\n\nWe can construct a 3D DP table:\n\n| nums[0] | nums[1] | nums[2] |\n| ------- | ------- | ------- |\n| -1 | 1 | 2 |\n| -1 | 1 | 3 |\n| 4 | 3 | 2 |\n| -1 | -1 | 1 |\n| 1 | 1 | 2 |\n| 4 | 2 | 1 |\n| ...\n\nFrom the 3D DP table we can draw a picture:\n\n\nThe idea is that we consider each element in the 3D DP table as the bottom right corner of a rectangle (or pyramid).

So the question basically asked that I need to convert the given code from that question into something more efficient.\n\nApproach:\n\nThere are many approaches on how to do this problem. \nBut I am using greedy approach. \nWe will do things by giving as much as possible and greedily by finding the maximum bottles.\n\n1. If there are 3 bottles when we are not using any of them. We can buy it one bottles and we'll get 2 bottles. Then we buy the bottle which we have left and we will get 1 bottles. Now it will be 3 bottles.\n2. If there are 5 bottles when we are not using any of them. We can buy it two bottles and we'll get 4 bottles. Then we buy the bottle which we have left and we will get 3 bottles. Now it will be 7 bottles.\n3. If we buy one bottle we have 5 bottles. Now 3 bottles can be covered with 3 bottles of juice. If 2 bottles can be covered with one bottle of juice. so 7 - 3 = 4 bottles can be covered with one bottle of juice. And now if we buy 3 bottles of juice then we will get 6 bottles. \n4. So after each buy 1 bottle we can get 2 bottles. So at every step the question asks that I get to use half of the bottles if possible and if it is not possible then I will use full bottle. \n5. So it was the same as what we learnt in leetcode-852-Peak Index in Mountain Array.\n\nFor example:\nnumBottles: 10, numExchange: 4\n\nAt first step:\n- we have 10 bottles, we can buy 4 bottles and we'll get 6 bottles. So at this step we get to use half of the bottles. So we have to use the same logic for the next step.\n\nIn case if we use the same"}
